Currently I am the math department's [Pedagogy Fellow](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/people/gwyneth-moreland). Among other duties, I help facilitate TUMS, the Harvard Math Department's teaching training course for the first year graduate students.

I currently hold office hours 3:30-4:30pm in the common room on Fridays. NOTE: today, Feb 17, they will be held in SC 530.
