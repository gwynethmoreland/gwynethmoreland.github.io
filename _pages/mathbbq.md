mathbbq is a social club and outreach group for LGBTQIA math-interested folks at Harvard. It is open to all levels in the department: undergrads, grad students, post-docs, preceptors, faculty, etc. You do not need to be a math concentrator to join, just interested in mathematics.

We host around 6 events during the academic year, as well as some summer meetups.

I am currently president. We are always looking for help with organizing. Email EMAIL to get on the mailing list or to inquire about volunteering.
